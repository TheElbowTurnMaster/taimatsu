# taimatsu
Taimatsu (松明), meaning torch, sounds kind of like timer. Chrome extension that keeps track of time spent reading on web pages. It also bookmarks and logs time on local books. Intended to be used as a tool to track amount of time spent reading in another language.

The current plan is to turn Taimatsu into a React extension, but I made this basic program as a proof of concept and to learn the basics of Javascript.
